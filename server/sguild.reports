# This file contains the standard REPORT elements.
# format is:
# <name>||<description>||<type>||<sql statement>||<Number of fields>||
# <name> is a short name for the report.
# <description> is a full title for the report.  This is what will appear on the actual report.
# <type> is one of "query" for SQL-based report elements or "text" for report text blocks
# <sql statement> is the FULL sql statement to generate the data.  
# <number of fields> is the number of fields the query returns
#
#SQL SYNTAX NOTE:  Use the macros %%SENSORS%%, %%STARTTIME%%, and %%ENDTIME%% to allow for specifying these
# Criteria from the GUI.  If you use the %%SENSORS%% macro, make sure you properly join the sensor table.
# The %%SENSORS%% macro will expand to ( sensor.sid = 'sensor1' OR sensor.sid = 'sensor2' ), if sensor1 and sensor2 
# were selected from the GUI.
# See the provided examples for proper use.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE:  To support multiline text element make sure that ALL elements end with ||.  
# New lines DO NOT signify the start of a new element
#
# LAYOUT NOTE:  Put numerical elements first in your SELECT statements, it will make the output look better.
