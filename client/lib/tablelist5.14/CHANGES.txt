What is new in Tablelist 5.14?
------------------------------

1. Added the "-colorizecommand" configuration option, enabling you to
   change the colors of arbitrary character regions within the cells of
   the currently visible tablelist rows (thanks to Peter Spjuth for his
   proposal).

2. The "curcellselection" and "curselection" subcommands now accept an
   optional argument with the possible values "-all", "-nonhidden", and
   "-viewable" (thanks to Will Duquette for his proposal).

3. Added the tree styles "plain1", ..., "plain4", "bicolor1", ...,
   "bicolor4", and "classic1", ..., "classic4", suitable for use with
   large fonts and images (needed on high-resolution displays).  In
   addition, the sizes used by the tree styles "vistaAero",
   "vistaClassic", "win7Aero", and "win7Classic" are now automatically
   adapted to the display's scaling level (thanks to Harald Oehlmann for
   his proposal).

4. On Windows Vista and later, automatic scaling is now performed for
   the default arrow style, too.  This made is necessary to add the
   arrow styles "flat11x6" and "flat15x8".

5  Added the arrow style "flat8x4" and the tree style "ubuntu2", suiting
   version 15.04 of the Ubuntu Linux distribution.  Similarly, added the
   tree style "yuyo", inspired by the GTK+ theme Yuyo on Ubuntu MATE.

6. Changed the default arrow color "" and arrow style "sunken10x9" to
   "black" and "flat7x5" on the windowing system "x11" and for the tile
   themes "alt", "clam", "default", "kroc", "sriv", "srivlg", and "step"
   (POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY!).

7. In case of "-selecttype cell", the row containing the active cell is
   now displayed with raised relief (thanks to Holger Jakobs for his
   proposal).

8. Guarded against invocations of the "update" command from within
   binding scripts associated with the <<TablelistSelect>> virtual
   event (thanks to Martyn Smith for his bug report and discussions on
   this topic).

9. Worked around some unexpected events in certain X11 environments,
   which prevented Tablelist 5.13 from starting the interactive cell
   editing in such environments (thanks to Toni Giorgino for his bug
   report and helping me to reproduce this problem).

What was new in Tablelist 5.13?
-------------------------------

1. Added support for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) (thanks to Kevin Walzer
   for his proposal).

2. Renamed the four arrow styles having the shape of an angle from
   "flat7x5", ..., "flat10x6" to "flatAngle7x5", ..., "flatAngle10x6"
   (POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY!); added the arrow styles "flat7x5",
   "flat9x6", "flatAngle7x4" (which is now the default on Yosemite),
   "flatAngle9x5", and "flatAngle10x7".

3. Added the tree style "mate", inspired by a few GTK+ themes of the
   MATE desktop.

4. Added the "-showeditcursor" configuration option, used to let the
   cursor take on the shape of a pencil whenever a mouse click would
   start an editing session (thanks to Rene Zaumseil and Cesare
   Bavazzano for their proposals).

5. New column configuration option "-changetitlesnipside", which allows
   you to override the alignment-specific default snip side for the
   column's title (thanks to John Vella for his proposal).

6. Support for the word "last" as row, column, cell, or child index,
   indicating the last row/column/cell of the tablelist or the last
   child of a given parent node (remember that the meaning of "end" as a
   row, column, or child index is subcommand-specific).

7. The description of the "imagelabelpath" subcommand in the reference
   manual now contains an example showing how to define bindings for the
   embedded images.

8. Eliminated the endless loop generated by the "yview" subcommand when
   synchronizing two or more tablelist widgets (thanks to Paul Obermeier
   for his bug report).

What was new in Tablelist 5.12.1?
---------------------------------

This is a bugfix-only release.  The corrected files in the "scripts"
directory are "tablelistEdit.tcl" and "tablelistUtil.tcl".

1. Appended the missing 4th argument to the two invocations of the
   procedure "tablelist::moveOrActivate" in the file
   "tablelistEdit.tcl" (thanks to Patrick Fradin and Ralf Fassel for
   their bug reports).

2. Fixed a typo in the file "tablelistUtil.tcl" (Thanks to Patrick
   Fradin for reporting this bug).

What was new in Tablelist 5.12?
-------------------------------

1. Added the "-customdragsource" configuration option, used to indicate
   whether the tablelist widget is a drag source for some drag & drop
   implementation other than TkDND and the drag & drop framework
   included in BWidget.

2. Improvements and extensions in the default binding scripts.  Besides
   providing full compatibility with the Tk listbox, they now perform an
   automatic drag-friendly handling of the selection and of pointer
   movements with mouse button 1 down if the "-customdragsource" option
   was set to true or the tablelist's body was registered as a TkDND or
   BWidget drag source (thanks to Will Duquette for his proposal).  The
   same holds true for the local drag & drop via the "move" subcommand.

3. Added the "hidetargetmark", "showtargetmark", "targetmarkpath", and
   "targetmarkpos" subcommands, for enhanced drop target support (thanks
   to Trevor Williams for his proposal).

4. Added a "Drag & Drop Support" section to the reference manual, with
   examples demonstrating the use of the new subcommands mentioned
   above in a tablelist widget registered as a TkDND or BWidget drop
   target.

5. The visibility of the horizontal separator placed just below the last
   tablelist row if the value of the "-showseparators" option is true
   and that of the "-fullseparators" option is false, can now be 
   controlled with the aid of the new "-showhorizseparator"
   configuration option (thanks to Martyn Smith for his proposal).

6. New values "flat5x3" and "flat5x4" for the "-arrowstyle"
   configuration option, suiting current versions of the Ubuntu Linux
   distribution.

7. Adapted the look & feel of the tree styles "adwaita", "ubuntu", and
   "mint" to current versions of the GTK+ 3 theme Adwaita and of the
   Linux distributions Ubuntu Linux and Linux Mint, respectively.

8. Fixed a long-standing bug related to horizontal scrolling in an empty
   tablelist widget with positve "-titlecolumns" value (thanks to Ulrich
   Seidl for his bug report).

What was new in Tablelist 5.11?
-------------------------------

1. Added the "findrowname" and "findcolumnname" subcommands (thanks to
   Adrian Medrano Calvo for his proposal and discussions on this
   subject).

2. Collapsing a row no longer leads to renumbering the lines for the
   purpose of updating a column configured to display the line numbers
   (thanks to Will Duquette for his proposal).

3. For improved appearance, if the value of the "-showseparators" option
   is true and that of the "-fullseparators" option is false, then a
   horizontal separator is now placed just below the last tablelist row
   (thanks to Allan Silverstein for his proposal).

4. Worked around a peculiarity of Tk on Windows, which caused problems
   when resizing the tablelist window in the presence of embedded images
   or multi-line elements (thanks to Will Duquette for his bug report).

5. Added the missing actualization of the active and anchor row indices
   after moving an item to a different position (thanks to Will Duquette
   for his bug report).

6. Fixed two bugs in Tablelist_tile, related to header labels with
   embedded images (thanks to Ulrich Seidl for his bug reports).

7. Numerous further improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 5.10?
-------------------------------

1.  Added the "-acceptdropcommand" configuration option, used to control
    whether the local drag & drop may move a specified item just before
    a given row (thanks to Nagu and Georgios Petasis for discussions on
    this subject).

2.  Added the "-instanttoggle" configuration option, related to the cell
    editing with the aid of a Tk or tile checkbutton (thanks to Rich
    Wellner for his proposal and discussions on this topic).

3.  Added the "-tight" configuration option, used to eliminate the
    one-pixel additional space left below each tablelist row for Tk
    listbox compatibility (thanks to Koen Breugelmans for his proposal
    and discussions on this subject).

4.  Added the "isviewable" and "viewablerowcount" subcommands (thanks to
    Nagu for proposing the latter).

5.  Improvements related to the value of the "-data" option for the
    virtual events <<TablelistColumnMoved>> and <<TablelistRowMoved>>
    (thanks to Georgios Petasis for discussions on this topic).

6.  The item deletion has become significantly faster, especially in
    tablelists used as tree widgets and in the presence of embedded
    images and/or multi-line elements (thanks to Rob Ratcliff and Rene
    Zaumseil for requesting this performance improvement).

7.  Guarded against column deletions from within non-default binding
    scripts for the header labels (thanks to Ulrich Seidl for his
    input).

8.  Restored the support for Tcl/Tk versions earlier than 8.3, by
    cleaning up the use of elided text in the underlying text widget.
    Similarly, restored the support for Tcl/Tk 8.0, by cleaning up the
    use of "regsub" and that of the <MouseWheel> event (thanks to Joerg
    Mueck for reporting the first two issues).

9.  Improved the package loading mechanism (thanks to Paul Obermeier for
    his bug report).

10. Guarded against potential item insertions or deletions from within
    the command specified as the value of the "-editendcommand" option
    (thanks to Julian H J Loaring for his bug report).

11. Guarded against deletion of embedded images or windows from within
    the command specified as the value of the "-tooltipaddcommand"
    option (thanks to Jan Kandziora for his bug report).

12. Fixed a bug related to column deletion if the "-selecttype" option
    has the value "cell" (thanks to Ulrich Seidl for his bug report).

13. Several further code improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 5.9?
------------------------------

1. Added the "-valign" column and cell configuration option, for
   controlling the vertical alignment of embedded images and windows
   (thanks to Trevor Williams for his proposal).

2. The "-stripebackground" and "-stripeforeground" options can now be
   specified at column level, too (thanks to Christian Gollwitzer for
   his proposal).

3. Improvements related to the Windows 7 platform.

4. Worked around a text widget bug in Tk versions 8.5 and later, related
   to getting the index of the last line in the window if some of the
   lines are elided (thanks to Bernhard Wallner for his bug report).

5. Corrected a typo in the implementation of the "rowconfigure"
   subcommand, introduced in the last Tablelist version (thanks to Jerzy
   Witkowski for reporting this bug).

6. Fixed a bug related to resetting the "-(select)background" and
   "-(select)foreground options at column, row, and cell levels,
   introduced in the previous Tablelist version (thanks to Christian
   Gollwitzer for his bug report).

7. Several further improvements in the code, demo scripts, and
   documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 5.8?
------------------------------

1.  Support for interactive cell editing with the aid of the ctext
    widget (thanks to Sait Dogru for his proposal).

2.  Added the "canceledediting" subcommand (thanks to Martyn Smith for
    his proposal).

3.  The "selection" and "cellselection" subcommands have become by
    orders of magnitude faster (thanks to Jean-Francois Beaud for his
    input that motivated me to speed up these subcommands).

4.  The "-(select)background" and "-(select)foreground options at
    column, row, and cell levels now impose by far less performance
    penalty than in earlier Tablelist versions.

5.  The keyboard traversal during interactive cell editing is now aware
    of changes like appending a new row, performed by the procedure
    specified as the value of the "-editendcommand" configuration option
    (thanks to Andreas Leitgeb for his proposal).

6.  For Tk versions 8.5 or later, most virtual events are now generated
    with the "-data" option set to a suitable event-specific value
    (thanks to Christian Gollwitzer, Andreas Leitgeb, and Nagu for their
    proposals).

7.  Improvements related to the selection mode "extended".

8.  Worked around a peculiarity of Tk on Windows, related to deleting an
    embedded window while resizing a text widget interactively (thanks
    to Harald Oehlmann for his bug report and discussions on this
    topic).

9.  Eliminated a regression introduced in Tablelist version 5.6, related
    to vertical scrolling under Tk 8.5 or later in the presence of
    embedded images or windows (thanks to Patrick Fradin for reporting
    this bug).

10. Fixed a screen refresh problem introduced in Tablelist version 5.6,
    related to wrapped multiline elements (thanks to Rob for his bug
    report).

    valuable contribution).

12. Added a "Virtual Events" section to the reference manual (thanks to
    Andreas Leitgeb for his proposal).

What was new in Tablelist 5.7?
------------------------------

1.  Added the "cellbbox" subcommand.

2.  Added the "editinfo" subcommand (thanks to Trevor Williams for his
    proposal).

3.  Adapted the tree styles "ubuntu" and "mint" to the latest Ubuntu
    Linux and Linux Mint releases.

4.  Minor change related to the ttk::combobox widget used as edit window
    (thanks to Julian H J Loaring for his input).

5.  Improved the multi-platform support by increased use of virtual
    events.

6.  Worked around a bug in some earlier Tk versions, related to
    checkbuttons without indicator (thanks to Allan Silverstein for his
    input).

7.  Restored the support for Tcl/Tk versions earlier than 8.4, which has
    been broken since the previous Tablelist release, due to the use of
    the "namespace exists" command, introduced in Tcl 8.4 (thanks to
    Ralf Fassel for drawing my attention to this issue).

8.  Fixed a copy & paste bug related to embedded windows, introduced in
    the previous Tablelist version (thanks to Heng Li and David Hanks
    for their bug reports).

9.  Fixed a long-standing bug related to the "cancelediting" subcommand
    and the "-forceeditendcommand" option (thanks to Julian H J Loaring
    for his bug report).

10. Fixed a long-standing minor bug that caused the "-labelbg" column
    configuration option to be accepted by Tablelist_tile, contrary to
    the option of the same name at widget level (thanks to Bernhard
    Wallner for his bug report).

11. Several further improvements in the code and demo scripts (thanks to
    Patrick Fradin for his valuable contribution and to Marianne Baumann
    for her input related to the "-showlabels" option).

What was new in Tablelist 5.6?
------------------------------

1.  Added the tree styles "adwaita", "mint", and "ubuntu", inspired by a
    few GTK+ 3 themes on popular Linux distributions.

2.  Added the "-windowupdate" cell configuration option (thanks to
    Trevor Williams for his valuable contribution).

3.  The item insertion and sorting have become significantly faster,
    especially when using static-width columns.

4.  Embedded windows are now hidden during interactive cell editing
    (thanks to Trevor Williams for discussions on this subject).

5.  Extended the support for the "tileqt" theme to work on KDE 4, too.

6.  Improvements in the documentation (thanks to Glenn Herteg for his
    proposal).

7.  Guarded against the case that a tablelist widget is deleted and its
    name is reused for a widget of a different class (thanks to Roger
    Niva for his valuable input).

8.  Guarded against scripts that start by destroying all children of the
    root window (thanks to Helmut Giese and Gerhard Kraus for drawing my
    attention to this case).

9.  Fixed two bugs related to the "move" subcommand, introduced in
    Tablelist version 5.2 (thanks to "DrS" and Trevor Williams for their
    bug reports).

10. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 5.5?
------------------------------

1. Hidden tablelist elements are no longer excluded from the selection
   (thanks to Martyn Smith for his proposal).  (They are, however,
   ignored when exporting the selection.)

2. Added the "cornerpath" and "cornerlabelpath" subcommands.  The first
   one makes it quite easy to respect the native Mac OS X look & feel,
   where the vertical scrollbar appears placed under the header (thanks
   to Torsten Berg for a related page on the Wiki, which provided me the
   idea for these subcommands).  The "cornerpath" subcommand is now used
   in all demo scrips that contain vertical scrollbars.

3. Added support for the appearance-related changes introduced in Mac
   OS X 10.7 (Lion).

4. On Mac OS X Aqua, the default values of the "-move(column)cursor"
   and "-resizecursor" options are now native cursors.  Besides
   improving the look & feel of tablelist widgets on the Mac, this
   change also works around the problem that on Mac OS X 10.7, Tk
   versions 8.5 and 8.6 can only use native and native-mapped cursors.

5. Removed the "-labelbackground" option from Tablelist_tile, because
   current versions of the tile engine no longer support setting the
   background color for the header labels (and even with earlier tile
   versions, some themes ignored any attempt to change the background
   color of the header labels).

6. Adapted the code to some changes in current tile versions, to make
   sure that in disabled state the tile-based column labels will appear
   in the theme-specific disabled foreground color, as it was the case
   with earlier tile versions (thanks to "tombert" for his related
   posting on comp.lang.tcl).

7. Improved a few binding scripts (thanks to Ulrich Seidl for his bug
   report and testing).

8. Fixed a bug related to embedded windows in a tablelist used as a
   tree widget (again, thanks to Ulrich Seidl for his bug report and
   testing).

9. Several further improvements in the code, demo scripts, and
   documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 5.4?
------------------------------

1. Added the "-populatecommand" configuration option, used by the
   "searchcolumn" subcommand to insert child items on demand before
   checking whether they contain the specified pattern.
   
2. Added the "-autoscan" configuration option, which can be used to
   deactivate the automatic scrolling triggered by leaving the
   tablelist window with mouse button 1 down, in order to avoid any
   conflicts with drag & drop via tkdnd (thanks to Patrick Fradin for
   his valuable contribution).

3. New "isexpanded" subcommand.

4. New value "flat9x6" for the "-arrowstyle" configuration option.

5. Adapted the tree style "oxygen2" to the look of current KDE 4
   versions.

6. Worked around some peculiarities of Tk on Mac OS X Aqua (thanks to
   Torsten Berg for her problem report and discussions on this topic).

7. Improved the check for PNG support in Tk (thanks to Ian Gay for his
   posting on the Wiki related to this subject).

8. Fixed a bug related to the tree style "aqua", introduced in
   Tablelist version 5.3 (thanks to Julian H J Loaring for his bug
   report).

9. Numerous further improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 5.3.1?
--------------------------------

This release contains just one bug-fix and an enhancement:

1. Fixed a bug related to the "-hide" row configuration option,
   introduced in the previous Tablelist version (thanks to Ralf Fassel
   and Michal Sosnowski for their bug reports).

2. Extended the support for the native "Aqua-blue" background for the
   header label of the sort column (which in the previous Tablelist
   release was restricted to Tk versions 8.6 and above) to the Cocoa-
   based Tk patch levels 8.5.9 and above (thanks to Kevin Walzer for
   discussions on this topic and to Paul Obermeier for enabling me to
   access the ActiveTcl 8.5.8 distribution for the Mac).

What was new in Tablelist 5.3?
------------------------------

1. The interactive row move operation (i.e., local drag & drop) now
   supports moving an item outside its parent and dropping it under
   another item as a child (thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth for his
   proposal, thorough testing, and discussions on this topic).

2. Added the "-acceptchildcommand" configuration option, related to the
   local drag & drop.

3. New "searchcolumn" subcommand, supporting a rich set of options
   (thanks to Matthew Callaghan, Adrian Davis, and Jeff Godfrey for
   their proposals).

4. New "getformatted", "getformattedcolumns", and "getformattedcells"
   subcommands.

5. Support for interactive cell editing with the aid of the Tk core and
   tile menubutton widgets (thanks to Georgios Petasis for his
   proposal).

6. Support for the row indices "top" and "bottom" (thanks to Julian H J
   Loaring and Paul Obermeier for their proposals).  Likewise, support
   for the column indices "left" and "right".

7. New value "photo7x7" for the "-arrowstyle" configuration option,
   needed for the "aqua" theme.

8. Adapted the appearance of tablelist widgets on the Macintosh to
   current versions of OS X Aqua.

9. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 5.2?
------------------------------

1.  Added the "-fullseparators" configuration option (thanks to Kevin
    Partin, Martyn Smith, and Harald Oehlmann for their proposals).

2.  Added the tree styles "ambiance", "dust", "dustSand", "newWave",
    "plastik", and "radiance".

3.  The implementation of the "collapse(all)" and "expand(all)"
    subcommands no longer makes use of the "-hide" row configuration
    option, hence you are now free to set the latter (via
    "rowconfigure", "configrowlist", "configrows", or "togglerowhide"),
    regardless of whether the tablelist widget displays a tree
    hierarchy or just a plain list.

4.  The "move" subcommand now supports moving an item outside its
    parent.

5.  Deleting the whole content of a tablelist widget has become
    significantly faster (thanks to Harold Campbell for his input).

6.  Worked around a peculiarity of the text widget related to tag
    handling when deleting a range of lines from its end (thanks to
    Batox for his bug report).

7.  Minor improvements and bug-fixes in the binding scripts (thanks to
    Bernhard Wallner, Batox, and Roger Niva for their bug reports).

8.  Fixed a bug related to the "-selecttype cell" configuration option,
    (re)introduced in Tablelist version 5.0 (thanks to Harold Campbell
    and Dietmar Mueller for their bug reports).

9.  Fixed a bug related to row hiding via "configrowlist" or
    "configrows", introduced in Tablelist version 5.0 (thanks to Michal
    Sosnowski for his bug report).

10. Fixed a long-standing bug related to tooltip support (thanks to
    Trevor Williams for his bug report).

11. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 5.1?
------------------------------

This is a bugfix-only release.  The corrected files in the "scripts"
directory are "tablelistBind.tcl", "tablelistSort.tcl",
"tablelistUtil.tcl", and "tablelistWidget.tcl".

1. Fixed a bug related to item deletion, introduced in the previous
   Tablelist version (thanks to Aric Bills and Roger Niva for their bug
   reports).

2. Fixed a bug related to multi-column sorting, introduced in the
   previous Tablelist version (thanks to Albrecht Mucha for his bug
   report).

3. Fixed a long-standing bug related to column deletion (thanks to
   Liang Sian Yin for his bug report).

4. Fixed a few further minor bugs and typos, introduced in the previous
   Tablelist version (thanks to Patrick Fradin, Roger Niva, Harald
   Oehlmann, and Peter Spjuth for their bug reports).

What was new in Tablelist 5.0?
------------------------------

1.  A tablelist widget is now not only a multi-column listbox, but also
    a multi-column tree widget (thanks to Sebastien Barre, Tillmann
    Basien, Jos Decoster, Dr. Detlef Groth, Kai Morich, Georgios
    Petasis, and Kevin Walzer for their proposals, as well as to Paul
    Obermeier for testing the preliminary version).  This is achieved
    with the aid of the new configuration options "-collapsecommand",
    "-expandcommand", "-treecolumn", and "-treestyle", along with the
    new subcommands "childcount", "childindex", "childkeys", "collapse",
    "collapseall", "depth", "descendantcount", "expand", "expandall",
    "expandedkeys", "insertchild(ren)", "insertchildlist", "noderow",
    "parentkey", and "toplevelkey".

2.  Added the "-editselectedonly" configuration option, related to
    starting the interactive cell editing with mouse button 1 (thanks to
    Julian H J Loaring for discussions on this topic).

3.  New values "flat6x4", "flat9x7", and "flat10x6" for the
    "-arrowstyle" configuration option.

4.  New value "asciinocase" for the "-sortmode" column configuration
    option.

5.  New subcommands "applysorting", "getfullkeys", and "refreshsorting".

6.  Two new demo scripts (and their tile-based counterparts)
    illustrating the use of a tablelist as multi-column tree widget.

7.  The subcommands "insert", "insertlist", "insertchild(ren)", and
    "insertchildlist" now return the list of full keys corresponding to
    the items just inserted.

8.  Fixed a long-standing bug related to the "-labelfont" option (thanks
    to Jacek Jendrysik for his bug report).

9.  Fixed a bug related to the "-text" column configuration option
    (thanks to Paul Obermeier for his bug report).

10. Fixed a long-standing bug related to embedded windows in right-
    aligned columns (thanks to Jerzy Witkowski for his bug report).

11. Numerous further improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 4.12?
-------------------------------

1.  Added the "labeltag" subcommand and the helper command "tablelist::
    getTablelistColumn", designed to be used in non-default binding
    scripts for the header labels.

2.  Support for interactive cell editing with the aid of the tile
    spinbox widget.  The demo script "tileWidgets.tcl" now uses this
    widget when available.

3.  Support for interactive cell editing with the aid of the new mentry
    widget for IPv6 addresses.

4.  Improved the support for Windows Vista and added explicit support
    for the "vista" theme.

5.  Updated the support for the themes "plastik" and "keramik"; added
    support for the "keramik_alt" theme.

6.  Support for the native "Aqua-blue" background, set for the header
    label of the sort column (thanks to Kevin Walzer for his proposal
    and valuable contribution).  For technical reasons, this feature is
    only supported for Mac-Tk versions using Cocoa.

7.  Further improvements in the support for Mac OS X Aqua (thanks to
    Daniel Steffen and Kevin Walzer for their valuable feedback).

8.  Improvements in the binding scripts related to interactive cell
    editing (thanks to Hadas Porat for discussions on this subject).

9.  The binding for the <Double-Button-1> event in the resize area of a
    column header now works as expected for large lists, too.

10. Eliminated a minor regression related to interactive cell editing,
    introduced in the previous Tablelist version (thanks to Kai Morich
    for his valuable input).

11. Fixed a small bug related to interactive cell editing with the aid
    of a text widget (thanks to Bryan Oakley for his bug report and
    valuable suggestion).

12. Fixed a long-standing bug related to the "-listvariable" option in
    disabled state (thanks to Ralf Fassel for his bug report).

13. Added a version-related hint to the "How to use it?" section of the
    Tablelist Programmer's Guide.

What was new in Tablelist 4.11?
-------------------------------

1.  Added the "-columntitles" configuration option, which is mainly a
    simplified form of the "-columns" option (thanks to Roy Terry for
    his proposal).

2.  Added the virtual events <<TablelistColHiddenStateChanged>> and
    <<TablelistRowHiddenStateChanged>>, generated after toggling the
    hidden state of a column or row, respectively (thanks to Jeff 
    Godfrey for his proposal).

3.  Besides with <Button-3>, the optimal column width can now be set
    with <Double-Button-1> in the resize area of the column's header.
    Similarly, the effect of <Shift-Button-3> can also be achieved with
    <Shift-Double-Button-1> in the column label's resize area.

4.  Support for Windows Vista (thanks to Jeremy Cowgar for his input).

5.  The recommended package name is now "tablelist" rather than
    "Tablelist", for compatibility with the ActiveTcl distribution; the
    demo scripts have been changed accordingly.

6.  Made sure that the "-tooltipdelcommand" configuration option won't
    affect other widgets (thanks to Jeff Godfrey for drawing my
    attention to this issue).

7.  Fixed a long-standing nasty bug related to the "yview" subcommand
    (thanks to Nestor Patino for his bug report and very helpful example
    script).

8.  Fixed two bugs related to the "-listvariable" configuration option
    (again, thanks to Nestor Patino for his valuable input).

9.  Fixed a bug related to the item deletion when using Tcl/Tk 8.5
    (thanks to Jos Decoster and Sven Wuytack for their valuable
    contribution to finding and fixing this bug).

10. Fixed a bug related to the "-windowdestroy" cell configuration
    option, introduced in Tablelist 4.9 (thanks to Sebastien Barre for
    his bug report).

What was new in Tablelist 4.10?
-------------------------------

1.  Support for individual binding scripts controlling the interactive
    cell editing, with the aid of the new "editwintag" subcommand
    (thanks to Oscar Fuentes for his valuable input).

2.  Complemented the "attrib" subcommand with the new subcommands
    "hasattrib" and "unsetattrib".

3.  Support for column-, row-, and cell-specific attributes, with the
    aid of the new subcommands "columnattrib", "hascolumnattrib",
    "unsetcolumnattrib", "rowattrib", "hasrowattrib", "unsetrowattrib",
    "cellattrib", "hascellattrib", and "unsetcellattrib".

4.  Support for interactive cell editing with the aid of the new mentry
    widget of type "DateTime", introduced in version 3.2 of the Mentry
    package (thanks to Florian Murr for his proposal).

5.  Made sure that the default bindings are set up immediately when
    loading the package, prior to creating any tablelist widget (thanks
    to Schelte Bron for his proposal and discussions on this topic).

6.  Re-established the support for tile widgets as edit windows in non-
    tile-based tablelist widgets (again, thanks to Schelte Bron for
    reporting that this was broken in the last few Tablelist versions).

7.  Adapted the handling of the tile checkbutton as edit window in the
    "xpnative" theme to some changes made in tile 0.8 (thanks to Jeff
    Godfrey for his bug report).

8.  Guarded against potential widget deletion from within user-defined
    binding scripts or "update (idletasks)" (thanks to Schelte Bron and
    Jan Kandziora for their bug reports).

9.  Updated the (very rarely needed) distribution file "repair.tcl" to
    work with current Tablelist versions (thanks to Robert Stollf for
    his bug report).

10. Corrected the description of the "-height" option in the reference
    manual (thanks to Glenn Herteg for his bug report concerning the
    case "-height 0").

11. Improved the color handling in the "disabled" state (thanks to Rolf
    Ade for his bug report and discussions on this topic).

12. Made the handling of elided text more robust (thanks to Jos Decoster
    for his bug report and valuable contribution).

13. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes (thanks to Albrecht
    Mucha for his valuable input).

What was new in Tablelist 4.9?
------------------------------

1.  Added the "-wrap" column configuration option, which makes it
    possible to display long texts in word-wrapped multi-line rather
    than snipped form (thanks to Alexander Schoepe and Anant Adke for
    their proposals).  Also, added support for interactive cell editing
    with a word- or char-wrapped text widget when using Tk 8.5 (thanks
    to Juberi Rajib for discussions on this topic).

2.  Support for dynamic-width embedded windows, with the aid of the new
    "-stretchwindow" cell configuration option (thanks to Kurt Kurczyk,
    Bryan Oakley, and Rasmus Debitsch for their proposals). The demo
    script "embeddedWindows.tcl" and its tile-based counterpart now make
    use of this option.

3.  New "formatinfo" subcommand, returning information about the cell
    whose content is being formatted by a command specified as the value
    of the "-formatcommand" column configuration option (thanks to Goran
    Ivankovic and Sebastien Barre for their proposals).

4.  Changed the default value of the "-activestyle" configuration option
    from "underline" to "frame" and that of the "-setfocus" option from
    0 to 1, making them conform to similar changes in Tk 8.5 related to
    the listbox widget.

5.  Improved the appearance of the header labels for the "aqua" theme
    (thanks to Torsten Berg for discussing this topic on the Wiki).

6.  Eliminated the potential invocation of the "unknown" command from
    within the Tablelist code (thanks to Roger Niva for discussions on
    this topic).

7.  When starting the interactive cell editing with the aid of a
    combobox widget, the list associated with the latter is only dropped
    down if the combobox is read-only (thanks to Bryan Oakley for his
    proposal).

8.  The "setThemeDefaults" command no longer throws an error if the
    current theme is not explicitly supported by Tablelist.  Instead, it
    uses the options set by the current theme and falls back to the
    "default" one for the rest (thanks to Schelte Bron for his valuable
    contribution).

9.  Improved the tablelist widget's appearance when the header labels
    are not shown (thanks to Mark Garvey for his input).

10. Fixed two bugs related to the optimized item insertion (thanks to
    Harold Campbell and Bryan Oakley for their bug reports).

11. Fixed a bug related to the "-showlinenumbers" column configuration
    option (thanks to Martin Lemburg for his bug report).

12. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 4.8?
------------------------------

This release fixes a few nasty bugs related to the optimized item
insertion, introduced in the previous Tablelist version (thanks to
Harold Campbell, Roger Niva, and Joerg Klingseisen for their bug
reports).

What was new in Tablelist 4.7?
------------------------------

1.  Significant performance improvements related to the "insert",
    "rowconfigure", "sort", "sortbycolumn", and "sortbycolumnlist"
    subcommands (thanks to Harold Campbell for his valuable
    contribution to speeding up the item insertion).  The extent of the
    speed-up depends on the configuration options present at column,
    row, and cell levels.

2.  Support for cell- and column label-specific balloon help, with the
    aid of the new configuration options "-tooltipaddcommand" and
    "-tooltipdelcommand".

3.  New subcommands "iselemsnipped" and "istitlesnipped", which make it
    very easy to display the full cell texts and column titles as
    tooltips for cells and header labels with snipped contents.

4.  New subcommands "configcolumnlist", "configcolumns",
    "configrowlist", "configrows", "configcelllist", and "configcells",
    which allow you to configure several columns/rows/cells with a
    single command invocation (thanks to Harold Campbell, Jeff Godfrey,
    and Paul Obermeier for their proposals).

5.  Worked around some performance problems regarding the "switch"
    command in Tcl 8.5a6/8.5b1 and ActiveTcl 8.4.14.

6.  Made sure that ActiveState's "style::as" package won't break the
    mousewheel bindings (thanks to Michael Schlenker for drawing my
    attention to this problem).

7.  Improved the focus handling when resizing a column interactively
    (thanks to Jorge Enderr for his bug report).

8.  Corrected a typo in the adaptation of vertical scrolling to the
    text widget changes made in Tk 8.5 (thanks to Julian M Noble for
    his posting on the Wiki related to this subject).

9.  Fixed a bug related to hidden rows when having "-selecttype cell",
    introduced in Tablelist version 4.3 (thanks to Harold Campbell for
    his bug report and discussions on this subject).

10. Fixed a bug in the "cellconfigure" subcommand, introduced in the
    previous Tablelist release (thanks to Roy Terry for reporting this
    problem on the Wiki).

11. Fixed a bug in the "-changesnipside" option (thanks to Kai Morich
    for his bug report).

12. Numerous further improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 4.6?
------------------------------

1.  Tablelist_tile now supports tile 0.8 and Tk 8.5a6/8.5b1 (where tile
    is integrated in the core).  The new commands "tablelist::setTheme",
    "tablelist::getCurrentTheme", and "tablelist::getThemes" enable you
    to set and get the current theme and to query the available ones,
    without having to worry about the incompatibilities between the
    various tile versions.

2.  New column configuration option "-changesnipside", which allows you
    to override the alignment-specific default snip side (thanks to
    Georgios Petasis for his proposal).

3.  New "columnwidth" subcommand, with the options "-requested",
    "-stretched", and "-total" (thanks to Matthew Callaghan, Richard
    Finstad, Lieven Forrez, and Tom Roeder for their proposals).

4.  Support for the new virtual event <<TablelistColumnResized>>,
    generated after resizing a column interactively (thanks to Kurt
    Kurczyk for his proposal).

5.  Visual improvement:  Within an active row, the gap to the left or
    right of an embedded image or window no longer appears underlined
    (when the "-activestyle" option has its default value "underline").

6.  Embedded images and windows are no longer hidden during interactive
    cell editing (except the editing with the aid of a Tk or tile
    checkbutton widget).

7.  Significantly improved the redraw and stretching behavior when
    resizing a column interactively.

8.  Eliminated some annoying visual effects caused by hidden columns
    when displaying the items of an already visible tablelist widget
    (thanks to Rolf Ade for discussions on this topic).

9.  Adapted the implementation of vertical scrolling to the text widget
    changes made in Tk 8.5 (thanks to Julian M Noble for his posting on
    the Wiki related to this subject).

10. Fixed a bug related to hidden rows, introduced in Tablelist version
    4.3 (thanks to Matthew Callaghan for his bug report).

11. Eliminated the possible endless loop caused by some option database
    settings in the "seecell" subcommand (thanks to Erik Allaert and
    Mauro Comin for reporting this bug).

12. Added a detailed performance-related hint to the description of the
    "-listvariable" configuration option.

13. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 4.5?
------------------------------

1.  Static-width columns are now displayed much faster than in earlier
    Tablelist releases.

2.  Quite significantly reduced the performance penalty imposed by
    various column, row, and cell configuration options when sorting,
    redisplaying, moving, or deleting tablelist items.

3.  Embedded images are now handled much more efficiently and are
    displayed much faster than in earlier Tablelist versions.

4.  New column configuration option "-showlinenumbers" (thanks to Rolf
    Schroedter and Sean Xu for their proposals and to Kathrin Klaes for
    testing the implementation).

5.  Support for tile-based multi-entry widgets (introduced in Mentry
    3.0) used as edit windows.

6.  Significantly improved the handling of the <<ThemeChanged>> virtual
    event.

7.  Defined more reasonable windowing system- and theme-specific default
    values for the "-arrowdisabledcolor" option.

8.  Improved and simplified the package loading mechanism (thanks to
    Andreas Kupries for his valuable contribution).

9.  Eliminated the "togglevisibility" subcommand, which was deprecated
    in the previous Tablelist version in favor of "togglecolumnhide".

10. Fixed a bug in the implementation of the "deletecolumns" subcommand,
    introduced in the previous Tablelist release (thanks to Kai Morich,
    Kurt Kurczyk, and Dave Leslie for their bug reports).

11. Fixed two binding-related bugs (thanks to Mark Garvey and Kurt
    Kurczyk for their bug reports).

12. Fixed a bug related to the handling of the "tileqt" theme (thanks to
    Andres Garcia for his bug report).

13. Fixed a small but annoying bug related to the "-maxwidth" column
    configuration option, introduced in the previous Tablelist version.

14. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes (thanks to
    Patrick Fradin and Georgios Petasis for their valuable feedback).

What was new in Tablelist 4.4?
------------------------------

1.  New row configuration option "-hide" (thanks to Jeff Godfrey,
    Patrick Fradin. Hemang Lavana, and Martyn Smith for their
    proposals, and especially to Harold Campbell for providing the
    initial implementation and testing the final one.)  For performance
    reasons this option is implemented by using elided text in the
    underlying text widget, and therefore it is not supported for Tk
    versions earlier than 8.3.

2.  New subcommand "togglerowhide" for hiding/unhiding several rows at
    a time (not supported for Tk versions earlier than 8.3).

3.  Renamed the "togglevisibility" subcommand to "togglecolumnhide".
    The old name is still supported, but will be eliminated in the next
    Tablelist release.

4.  New command "tablelist::setThemeDefaults", which can be used to
    make sure that classical Tk widgets, e.g., text, will have a theme-
    specific appearance, just like the tile widgets.  The tile-based
    demo scripts now make use of this command.

5.  When using the "tileqt" theme, the version number of TileQt must be
    0.3 or higher (thanks to Georgios Petasis for providing the new
    "tileqt" features used in this Tablelist release).

6.  For Tk 8.3 or later, hidden columns are now handled by using elided
    text, which results in very significant performance improvements
    (thanks to Harold Campbell for his valuable contribution).

7.  Improved the handling of the "-listvariable" option in connection
    with snit widgetadaptors (thanks to Rolf Ade for his bug-fix).

8.  Corrected a typo in the implementation of the "move" subcommand,
    introduced in the previous release (thanks to Jerome Siot for his
    bug report).

9.  Improved the handling of the virtual event <<ThemeChanged>> (thanks
    to Wofgang Grosser for his bug report).

10. Fixed a long-standing bug related to hidden columns (thanks to Dave
    Leslie for his bug report).

11. Worked around a peculiarity of the "place" command on Windows,
    which caused refresh problems in column labels with images (thanks
    to Sebastien Barre for his bug report).

12. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 4.3?
------------------------------

1. Support for multi-line cells:  Newline characters now force line
   breaks when displaying the items (thanks to Sebastien Barre,
   Tillmann Basien, Cameron Laird, Kai Morich, and Vaclav Snajdr for
   their proposals).  In addition, interactive cell editing can now
   take place with the aid of a text widget, too (this has caused a few
   minor changes in the default key bindings for the edit window).

2. Support for multi-column sorting with the aid of the new subcommands
   "sortbycolumnlist", "sortcolumnlist", and "sortorderlist", as well
   as of the new command "tablelist::addToSortColumns".  The latter is
   designed to be specified as the value of the new widget and column
   configuration option "-labelcommand2", whose value is invoked on 
   <Shift-Button-1> events.  Multi-column sorting is visualized by
   means of multiple sort arrows, which are displayed together with the
   corresponding sort ranks.  (Thanks to Harold Campbell for proposing
   most of these features, providing the initial implementation, and
   testing the final one.)

3. New configuration option "-setfocus", specifying whether mouse
   button 1 should set the focus to the tablelist's body (thanks to
   Tillmann Basien for discussions on this topic).

4. Replaced the contents of the directory "images" with a script file
   containing procedures that create the bitmap images from inline data
   (thanks to Mats Bengtsson, Patrick Fradin, and Kai Morich for their
   proposals).

5. Fixed a bug related to the use of a tile entry within a non-tile-
   based tablelist widget on Windows XP (thanks to Schelte Bron for his
   bug report).

6. The handling of <Command-Key> events during interactive cell editing
   is now explicitly restricted to Mac OS Classic and Mac OS X Aqua,
   because, strangely enough, on Windows these events are generated by
   simple keypresses if Num Lock is active.

7. Numerous further code improvements, minor bug-fixes, and support for
   several recent changes in tile.

8. Cleaned up the documentation, to make sure that the HTML files
   generated for the ActiveTcl distribution with the tool HTML Tidy
   will be syntactically identical to the original ones.

What was new in Tablelist 4.2?
------------------------------

1.  The resize area of the header labels now consists of a few pixels
    on both sides of the right edge (thanks to Bryan Oakley for
    suggesting this improvement).

2.  Made sure that the header labels have the right appearance in the
    "aqua" theme when using tile version 0.6.4 or later (thanks to
    Bryan Oakley for his bug report).

3.  Several further improvements related to Mac OS X Aqua (for example,
    support for the "Command" key during keyboard navigation between
    the editable cells).

4.  Fixed a very long-standing bug in the "containing" subcommand
    (thanks to Mats Bengtsson, Schelte Bron, and Mark Garvey for their
    bug reports).

5.  Fixed a bug related to the "xpnative" theme, introduced in the
    previous release (thanks to Mark Garvey, Jeff Godfrey, and Uwe
    Koloska for their bug reports).

6.  Fixed another very long-standing bug, related to insertion and
    deletion of columns having images in their labels (thanks to
    Sebastien Barre for his bug report).

7.  Fixed an old bug related to embedding images or windows into hidden
    cells (again, thanks to Sebastien Barre for reporting this bug).

8.  The demo scripts now work independently of their location (this
    small improvement reflects the fact that Tablelist is now included
    in tklib, where the examples are in a location different from
    "$tablelist::library/demos").

9.  Adapted two tile-based demo scripts to the recently released tile
    version 0.7.

10. Several further improvements in the code and documentation (thanks
    to Patrick Fradin for his valuable contribution).

What was new in Tablelist 4.1?
------------------------------

1.  Significantly extended the tile support in the Tablelist_tile
    package:  Header labels now look and behave like the column
    headings of treeview widgets, and over a dozen configuration
    options have theme-specific default values (thanks to Paul
    Obermeier for his excellent "poImgview" application, which helped
    me a lot during this work, as well as to Georgios Petasis for his
    Qt-related hints).

2.  Header labels containing the mouse cursor are now set into active
    state.  Their appearance is controlled in the Tablelist package by
    the new configuration options "-labelactivebackground" and
    "-labelactiveforeground", while the Tablelist_tile package uses
    theme-specific background and foreground colors for the active and
    pressed states of the labels.

3.  New configuration option "-arrowstyle", specifying the flat or
    sunken relief and the dimensions of the arrow indicating the
    sorting order.  This option has windowing system- and theme-
    specific default values.

4.  New configuration option "-protecttitlecolumns", used to protect
    the title column boundary from being crossed when moving a column
    interactively (thanks to Schelte Bron for his proposal).

5.  New configuration option "-spacing", specifying additional space to
    provide above and below each tablelist row (thanks to Sebastien
    Barre for his proposal).

6.  New column configuration option "-stretchable", complementing the
    global "-stretch" option (thanks to Sebastien Barre for his
    proposal).

7.  New row configuration option "-name", whose value can also be used
    as a row index and as the first component of a cell index (thanks
    to John Kozura for his proposal).

8.  New cell configuration option "-windowdestroy", specifying a script
    to be invoked when a window embedded into the cell is destroyed
    (thanks to Sebastien Barre for his proposal).

9.  New "imagelabelpath" subcommand (thanks to Schelte Bron for his
    proposal).

10. Keyboard navigation during interactive cell editing now works on
    Mac OS X Aqua, too.

11. Restored the support for Tcl/Tk versions earlier than 8.3, by
    cleaning up the handling of the "-titlecolumns" option (thanks to
    Andreas Flach and Brian O'Hagan for their bug reports).

12. Restored the support for Tcl/Tk versions earlier than 8.0.4, which
    has been broken since release 3.5, due to the use of the
    <MouseWheel> event, introduced in Tk 8.0.4 (thanks to Brian O'Hagan
    for his valuable contribution).

13. Worked around a peculiarity of the text widget's "dump -window"
    command (thanks to Greg Reynolds for his bug-fix).

14. Fixed a binding-related bug in "extended" selection mode (thanks to
    David Mattinson for his bug-fix).

15. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes (thanks to
    Schelte Bron, Patrick Fradin, Silas Justiniano, and Uwe Koloska for
    their bug reports and valuable contributions).

What was new in Tablelist 4.0?
------------------------------

1.  Support for the tile entry, combobox, and checkbutton widgets for
    interactive cell editing (thanks to Miguel Bagnon, Andy Black,
    Adrian Chan, and Mark Garvey for their proposals and to Mats
    Bengtsson and Kevin Walzer for their support on the Macintosh).
    See the new reference page "tablelistTile.html" for details.

2.  Support for tile-compatibility:  By just specifying "package
    require Tablelist_tile" instead of "package require Tablelist", the
    tablelist widgets will have a modern theme-specific appearance
    (again, thanks to the above-mentioned Tablelist users for their
    suggestions and assistance).  See the "How to use it?" and "More on
    Tablelist_tile" sections of the tutorial "tablelist.html" for
    details.

3.  New demo script "tileWidgets.tcl", illustrating the use of tile
    widgets for interactive cell editing and of the Tablelist_tile
    package.  All the other demo scripts are now provided in both a
    traditional and a tile-based version.  See the "Tile-based demo
    scripts" section of the tutorial "tablelist.html" for an example
    and some screenshots.

4.  The Tk checkbutton used for interactive cell editing is now a
    platform-specific checkbutton widget on Windows and the Macintosh
    (thanks to Mats Bengtsson for his help related to the Macintosh
    platform).

5.  The "-editwindow" option is now available at cell level, too
    (thanks to Kenneth Green for his proposal).

6.  New subcommand "togglevisibility" for hiding/unhiding several
    columns at a time (thanks to Stefan Finzel and Kai Morich for their
    proposals).

7.  Support for the new virtual event <<TablelistSelectionLost>>,
    generated when a tablelist widget having "-exportselection 1" loses
    the selection (thanks to Aldo Buratti for his proposal).

8.  After sorting the items, the "most important" row is automatically
    brought into view (thanks to Kai Morich for his valuable input).

9.  Worked around a peculiarity of Tk for Windows, related to mouse
    events (thanks to Tore Morkemo and Mike Collins for their bug
    reports).

10. Worked around a problem related to the visibility of the up/down-
    arrow on Mac OS X Aqua (thanks to Kevin Walzer for his bug report).

11. Fixed a bug in the "seecell" subcommand, introduced in Tablelist
    version 3.7 (thanks to Stefan Finzel for his bug report).

12. Fixed a bug in the "rowconfigure" subcommand, introduced in the
    previous Tablelist release (thanks to Tore Morkemo for his bug
    report).

13. Eliminated the memory leak caused by incomplete cleanup on deleting
    rows with embedded windows (thanks to David Cockerell for his bug
    report).

14. Fixed a small timing-related bug in the "editcell" subcommand
    (thanks to Kenneth Green for his bug report).

15. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes (thanks to Greg
    Reynolds for his valuable input).

What was new in Tablelist 3.8?
------------------------------

1. New configuration option "-forceeditendcommand", controlling the
   invocation of the script corresponding to the value of the
   "-editendcommand" option (thanks to Nestor Patino for his proposal).
 
2. New subcommands "getcells" and "windowpath" (thanks to Jeff Godfrey
   and Mike Collins for their proposals).

3. Support for the new virtual event <<TablelistCellRestored>>,
   generated by the "cancelediting" subcommand.

4. Significantly improved the performance of the "delete",
   "deletecolumns", and "movecolumn" subcommands for tablelist widgets
   having color or font options set at column, row, or cell level
   (thanks to Michael Bahr for his valuable feedback).

5. Improved the autoscrolling with the left mouse button in both the
   body and the header of a tablelist widget having title columns.

6. Fixed a bug related to the "-titlecolumns" option, introduced in the
   previous Tablelist release (thanks to Alexander Schoepe for his bug
   report).

7. Fixed a typo in the implementation of the "seecell" subcommand,
   introduced in the previous Tablelist release (thanks to Patrick
   Fradin for his bug report).

8. Improved the demo script "embeddedWindows.tcl" (thanks to Patrick
   Fradin for his valuable input).

9. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 3.7?
------------------------------

1. New configuration option "-titlecolumns", specifying the number of
   the non-scrollable columns at the left edge of the window (thanks to
   Goran Ivankovic, Paul Kienzle, Hemang Lavana, and Takeshi Sakamoto
   for their proposals).  For technical reasons (the use of the
   "-elide" option for a text widget tag), this option is not supported
   for Tk versions earlier than 8.3.

2. Extended the "separatorpath" and "separators" subcommands, to
   support the new special separator, which is displayed to mark the
   end of the title columns, independently of the value of the
   "-showseparators" option.

3. The "-stripebackground" and "-stripeforeground" options now have a
   higher priority than the "-background" and "-foreground" column
   configuration options, respectively (see the demo script
   "styles.tcl", which has been extended to illustrate this change).

4. Improved the handling of embedded images with transparent
   background, complementing the changes made in the previous Tablelist
   release (thanks to Kai Morich for his valuable contribution).

5. Improved the implementation of the "seecell" subcommand for centered
   and right-aligned columns.

6. Fixed two bugs related to the "rowconfigure" subcommand, introduced
   in Tablelist version 3.5 (thanks to Ted Branscomb and Roger Niva for
   their bug reports).

7. Fixed an old bug related to the "movecolumn" subcommand.

8. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 3.6?
------------------------------

1.  Support for embedded windows, with the aid of the new cell
    configuration option "-window" (thanks to Wolf Grossi, Glenn
    Herteg, Takeshi Sakamoto, and Keesang Song for proposing this
    option).

2.  New demo script "embeddedWindows.tcl" illustrating the use of
    embedded windows in tablelist widgets; this is discussed in a new
    section of the tutorial "tablelist.html".

3.  Significantly improved and optimized the handling of embedded
    images.

4.  Simplified the support for user-defined binding scripts with the
    aid of the new commands "tablelist::getTablelistPath" and
    "tablelist::convEventFields", as well as of a new binding tag whose
    name is returned by the new "bodytag" subcommand (which is now used
    in the demo script "browse.tcl").

5.  Support for the new virtual events <<TablelistRowMoved>>,
    <<TablelistColumnMoved>>, <<TablelistColumnSorted>> and
    <<TablelistCellUpdated>> (thanks to John Vidolich for his
    proposal).  In addition, the new virtual event <<TablelistSelect>>
    can now be used instead of <<ListboxSelect>> (which is supported
    for compatibility reasons).

6.  New subcommand "itemlistvar", for accessing the tablelist widget's
    internal list (thanks to Patrick Fradin for his valuable input).

7.  Fixed a bug related to the "-listvariable" option, introduced in
    the previous Tablelist release (thanks to Torsten Reincke for his
    bug report).

8.  Fixed two bugs related to the "cellselection" subcommand (thanks to
    John Vidolich for his bug report).

9.  Fixed a few typos and minor bugs in the default binding scripts
    (thanks to Patrick Fradin, Tore Morkemo, and Torsten Reincke for
    their bug reports).

10. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 3.5?
------------------------------

1.  New configuration option "-selecttype" with the values "row" and
    "cell", and new binding scripts supporting these two selection
    types (thanks to Kevin Partin for his proposal and to Dietmar
    Mueller for his valuable contribution).

2.  New subcommands "activatecell", "cellselection", and
    "curcellselection", used in the binding scripts mentioned above.

3.  The words "active" and "anchor" are now recognized as valid column
    and cell indices, too.

4.  New configuration options "-movablerows" and "-movecursor", and new
    mouse bindings for moving a row interactively (thanks to Dan Rogahn
    for his valuable contribution).

5.  The key sequences used for navigation between the editable cells
    now also move the active item or element and change the
    (cell)selection and the (cell)selection anchor in the body of the
    tablelist widget.

6.  Improved the handling and appearance of the checkbutton widget when
    used as edit window (thanks to Kevin Partin for reporting a problem
    experienced when the tablelist is embedded into an Iwidgets
    dialogshell).

7.  The "-listvariable" option now supports variable names returned by
    the "itcl::scope" command, too (thanks to Nicolae Mihalache for his
    bug report).

8.  Fixed a very long-standing bug related to horizontal scrolling when
    using a non-default font (thanks to Brand Hilton for his bug report
    and fix).

9.  Fixed another very long-standing bug, related to list variables
    (thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth and John R. Smith for their bug
    reports).

10. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes (thanks to
    Patrick Fradin for his valuable input).

What was new in Tablelist 3.4?
------------------------------

1.  New column configuration option "-editwindow", specifying the
    widget type used for interactive cell editing in the respective
    column (thanks to Damon Courtney, Patrick Fradin, and Keesang Song
    for their proposals and to Mats Bengtsson and Benny Riefenstein for
    their help related to the Macintosh platform).  The edit window may
    be a Tk core entry, spinbox, or checkbutton, or one of the 16
    supported widgets from the packages BWidget, Iwidgets, combobox (by
    Bryan Oakley), and Mentry.

2.  New subcommand "editwinpath".

3.  Three new demo scripts illustrating the use of the "-editwindow"
    option; these are discussed in a new section of the tutorial
    "tablelist.html".

4.  New column configuration option "-maxwidth" (thanks to Tore Morkemo
    for his proposal).

5.  The <Shift-Button-3> event in a column label now restores the
    column's last static width (thanks to Dietmar Mueller for his
    valuable input).

6.  Changing a tablelist's font now updates the column widths
    accordingly.

7.  Improved the handling of the "-setgrid" option.

8.  Improved the error handling related to the option database in the
    general mega-widget utility module "mwutil.tcl".

9.  Fixed a minor bug in the "containingcolumn" subcommand (thanks to
    David Mattinson for his bug report).

10. Restored the support for Tcl/Tk versions earlier than 8.0.4, which
    has been broken since release 3.0, due to the use of the
    <MouseWheel> event, introduced in Tk 8.0.4.

11. Further code improvements (thanks to Patrick Fradin for his
    valuable input).

12. Many improvements in the documentation, including a new Quick
    Reference section (thanks to Dietmar Mueller for his valuable
    contribution).

What was new in Tablelist 3.3?
------------------------------

1. New column configuration option "-text" (thanks to Paul Kienzle for
   his proposal).

2. New subcommands "containing", "containingcolumn", "containingcell",
   and "fillcolumn".

3. New subcommands "deletecolumns", "insertcolumns", and
   "insertcolumnlist" (thanks to Kevin Partin and Paul Kienzle for
   their proposals).

4. Renamed the subcommands "getcolumn" and "getkey" to "getcolumns" and
   "getkeys", respectively.  (This won't break any existing scripts,
   because the old command names are abbreviations of the new ones.)

5. Restored the support for Tcl/Tk versions earlier than 8.4, which was
   broken in Tablelist 3.1 and 3.2, due to the use of the improved
   syntax of the "place configure" command, introduced in Tk 8.4
   (thanks to David Mattinson, Kurt Braganza, and Alexander Baath for
   reporting this problem).

6. Fixed a bug in the "editcell" subcommand, introduced in Tablelist
   3.1 (thanks to Damon Courtney for his bug report).

7. Improved the demo script "config.tcl" (thanks to Mats Bengtsson for
   his input).

8. Restructured the code by moving several procedures from the
   distribution file "tablelistWidget.tcl" into smaller, more
   manageable modules.

9. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 3.2?
------------------------------

1. The key associated with a tablelist item can now be used as a row
   index and as the first component of a cell index of the form
   "row,col".

2. The "delete", "get", "getcolumn", "getkey", "selection clear", and
   "selection set" subcommands now also accept a list of indices as
   single argument (thanks to Damon Courtney and Erik Leunissen for
   their proposals).

3. Made the interactive "movecolumn" operation more intuitive and
   compatible with the behavior exhibited by similar actions in popular
   applications on various platforms (thanks to Paul Kienzle for his
   suggestion).  For example, the target position of the column being
   moved is now indicated by a temporary gap displayed in the
   tablelist's header.

4. New configuration option "-targetcolor", used to set the color of
   the gap mentioned above.

5. Fixed a bug related to the <MouseWheel> event, caused by a missing
   close-bracket in the last release (thanks to Patrick Fradin for his
   bug report).

6. Fixed a bug that raised an error in the "movecolumn" command for an
   empty tablelist widget (thanks to Paul Kienzle for his bug report).

7. The workaround in the "xview" and "yview" subcommands for a Tk bug
   under Mac OS X Aqua is now only activated for that windowing system,
   since (as reported by Patrick Fradin) it caused problems on some
   other systems.

8. Further minor code improvements.

What was new in Tablelist 3.1?
------------------------------

1.  New configuration options "-movablecolumns" and
    "-movecolumncursor".

2.  New column configuration option "-name", whose value can also be
    used as a column index and as the second component of a cell index
    of the form "row,col".

3.  New subcommands "move", "movecolumn", "getcolumn", "getkey", and
    "finishediting" (thanks to Damon Courtney, Daniel Fehrenbach, Jeff
    Godfrey, and Kevin Partin for their proposals).

4.  Extended the scope of the "cancelediting" subcommand.

5.  New mouse bindings for moving a column interactively.

6.  The autoscrolling, as described in the "DEFAULT BINDINGS" section
    of the "listbox" manual entry, is now implemented for the header of
    a tablelist widget, too.

7.  The interactive cell editing is now finished by any mouse click in
    the tablelist's body, outside the cell just being edited (thanks to
    Patrick Fradin and Jeff Godfrey for this suggestion).

8.  The value returned by the "selection includes" command no longer
    depends on the tablelist's state.

9.  Worked around a bug in Tk 8.4.0 and 8.4.1 related to the "selection
    handle" command, which caused crashes under KDE 3.0 (thanks to
    Andres Garcia for reporting this and to Joe English for suggesting
    the workaround and fixing the bug in Tk 8.4.2).

10. Improved the support of Mac OS X Aqua and Mac OS Classic (thanks to
    Mats Bengtsson, Raymond Calande, Techin Alex Kang, Bernhard
    Spinnler, and especially to Benny Riefenstein for their valuable
    contributions).

11. Fixed a bug related to the invocation of the "cellconfigure"
    subcommand from within a pre-edit callback (thanks to Dr. Johannes-
    Heinrich Vogeler for his bug report).

12. Several performance improvements (thanks to Patrick Fradin for his
    valuable suggestions).

13. Improved the platform-specific stuff in the demo scripts
    "config.tcl" and "browse.tcl".

14. Numerous further improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 3.0?
------------------------------

The main new feature provided by this release is the support for
interactive cell editing (thanks to Juri Shimon, Dr. Johannes-Heinrich
Vogeler, and Jeff Godfrey for their proposal).  The first three items
below are related to this subject:

1. New configuration options "-editstartcommand" and "-editendcommand".

2. New column and cell configuration option "-editable".

3. New subcommands "editcell", "entrypath", "cancelediting", and
   "rejectinput".

Further changes:

4. New subcommands "seecolumn" and "seecell".

5. Tabulator and newline characters are now retained in the internal
   list, displayed as "\t" and "\n", and supported by interactive cell
   editing (thanks to Jacek Jenrysik for his query concerning multi-
   line items).

6. The redisplay and sorting of tablelist items have become
   dramatically faster (thanks to Matt Becker for his input that
   determined me to optimize these operations, and also for his
   testing).

7. Further performance improvements (thanks to Patrick Fradin for his
   valuable contribution).

8. The option values displayed by the demo script "config.tcl" can now
   be edited interactively.

9. Minor improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 2.8?
------------------------------

1. The trailing or leading ellipsis ("...") used when displaying the
   elements that don't fit into their cells can now be replaced with an
   arbitrary string specified with the aid of the new "-snipstring"
   configuration option (thanks to Tore Morkemo for his proposal).

2. New value "none" for the "-activestyle" configuration option.

3. When exporting the selection, the elements of the hidden columns are
   now skipped and the contents of the visible cells are transformed
   according to the value of the "-formatcommand" option for the
   corresponding columns.

4. Improved and simplified the focus control (thanks to Juri Shimon and
   Gopal Reddy for their bug reports).

5. Further minor code improvements.

What was new in Tablelist 2.7?
------------------------------

1. Increased the speed of the "insert" and "insertlist" subcommands as
   well as that of item insertions with the aid of the "-listvariable"
   option by a factor of about 1.3.  The "insert" subcommand is now
   about 2.3 times faster than in version 2.4.  Compared to version
   2.4, item insertion with the aid of the "-listvariable" option has
   become more than 10 times faster.

2. The number of pixels by which a column is stretched is now
   proportional to its width in pixels.  Based on this change,
   significantly improved the stretching behavior after an interactive
   column resize operation (thanks to Mats Bengtsson for his valuable
   suggestions).

3. Fixed a bug in the "-(label)font" and "-labelborderwidth"
   configuration options, introduced in version 2.5 (thanks to Bastien
   Chevreux for his bug report).

4. Fixed a bug in the "columncget", "rowcget", and "cellcget"
   subcommands, introduced in version 2.3 (again, thanks to Bastien
   Chevreux for reporting this bug).

5. Fixed a bug in the binding scripts for the binding tag
   "TablelistBody" (thanks to Miguel Bagnon for his bug report).

6. Applied a patch proposed by Jeff Adamczak that works around a bug in
   the "lsort" command, present in Tcl versions 8.0 - 8.3.2.

7. Applied a patch proposed (in a slightly different form) by Mats
   Bengtsson that works around a bug in the "info script" command on
   the Macintosh.

8. Further minor code improvements.

What was new in Tablelist 2.6?
------------------------------

The only change in this version is a bug-fix eliminating a rather nasty
bug in the "insert" and "insertlist" subcommands, introduced in the
previous release.  Thanks to Mats Bengtsson for his bug report and to
Jeffrey Hobbs for suggesting me to bump the version number to 2.6.

What was new in Tablelist 2.5?
------------------------------

1. Increased the speed of the "insert" subcommand by a factor of about
   1.8 and that of item insertions with the aid of the "-listvariable"
   option by a factor of about 8.  (These figures are based on speed
   measurements made with two tablelist widgets: one having 1000 rows
   and 10 columns and another one with 5000 rows and 20 columns.)

2. The "delete", "sort", and "sortbycolumn" subcommands, as well as row
   and cell updates with the aid of the "rowconfigure" and
   "cellconfigure" operations have also become significantly faster.

3. New "insertlist" subcommand.

4. New "-stripeheight" configuration option (thanks to Gregory Samoluk
   for his proposal).

5. If no columns are to be stretched then the blank space following the
   header labels is now filled with a dummy, insensitive label having
   the same background, borderwidth, and relief as the "normal" header
   labels.

6. Fixed a bug concerning the placement of the arrow indicating the
   sorting order (thanks to Robert Minichino for his bug report).

7. Improved the handling of header labels with embedded images, to
   eliminate some peculiarities experienced on Windows.

8. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 2.4?
------------------------------

1. New column configuration option "-formatcommand" (thanks to Jeff
   Godfrey for his proposal).  This option is now used in the demo
   script "browse.tcl".

2. New row configuration option "-selectable" (thanks to Tore Morkemo
   for this proposal).

3. Significantly improved the performance of the row and cell updates,
   as well as of the "delete" subcommand (thanks to Emanuele Lupi for
   her input that determined me to optimize these operations).

4. The widget implementation is now fully compatible with the recent
   changes made in Tk 8.4a4 (thanks to Patrick Fradin for his input).

5. Pop-up menus as children of a tablelist widget cause no problem any
   longer (thanks to Andres Garcia and Bastien Chevreux for reporting
   this bug, introduced in the previous release).

6. Fixed a bug caused by the delayed redisplay after changing the
   number of columns (thanks to Tore Morkemo for his bug report).

7. Minor improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 2.3?
------------------------------

1. New configuration option "-activestyle", enabling to surround the
   active item with a frame instead of underlining it.

2. The columns can now be separated with borders, by making use of the
   new configuration option "-showseparators".

3. A nice distinguishing effect for the rows can now be obtained with
   the aid of the new configuration options "-stripebackground" and
   "-stripeforeground".

4. New tablelist widget subcommands "separatorpath" and "separators".

5. Fixed a bug related to the column index if the header labels are
   hidden (thanks to Emanuele Lupi for her bug report).

6. New demo script "styles.tcl", showing several ways to improve the
   appearance of a tablelist widget.

7. The demo scripts "config.tcl" and "browse.tcl" now make use of the
   new "-stripebackground" option.

8. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes (thanks to Patrick
   Fradin for his valuable input).

What was new in Tablelist 2.2?
------------------------------

1. The "-font" configuration option can now be specified at column,
   row, and cell level, too (this was proposed and partly implemented
   by Patrick Fradin).  The data will be aligned properly, no matter if
   the fonts are of different sizes.

2. Significantly improved the performance of the Tcl command associated
   with a tablelist widget, especially that of the "delete", "sort",
   and "sortbycolumn" subcommands for a large number (i.e., several
   thousands) of items.

3. Corrected the creation of the arrow indicating the sorting order, to
   make sure that it works under all supported Tcl/Tk versions (thanks
   to Juri Shimon and Andres Garcia for their bug reports).

4. Several improvements in the demo scripts "config.tcl" and
   "browse.tcl".  Among others, the GUIs generated by these scripts now
   have a better platform-specific look & feel (many thanks to Mats
   Bengtsson for his valuable suggestions concerning the Macintosh
   platform).

5. Further minor improvements in the code.

What was new in Tablelist 2.1?
------------------------------

1. The up- or down-arrow indicating the sorting order now has a 3-D
   border, giving the arrow a sunken relief.

2. Due to the new 3-D look of the arrow, the default values of the
   "-arrowcolor" and "-arrowdisabledcolor" configuration options have
   been changed to an empty string, indicating that the arrow will
   inherit the background color of the label in which it is placed.

3. Several improvements in the demo script "browse.tcl".

4. Minor improvements in the code and documentation.

5. The distribution file "tablelist2_1.zip" for Windows now includes
   the "tablelist2.1" directory, hence it is no longer necessary to
   create this folder before unpacking the distribution file (thanks to
   Kevin Partin for this suggestion).

What was new in Tablelist 2.0?
------------------------------

1.  New cell configuration option "-image", used to set and retrieve
    the image to be displayed (by itself or together with a text) in a
    cell of a tablelist widget.

2.  New column configuration option "-labelimage" specifying the image
    to be displayed (by itself or combined with a text) in a column
    label.

3.  The alignment of a header label can now be defined to be different
    from that of the elements contained in its column, by using the new
    column configuration option "-labelalign".

4.  Renamed the column configuration option "-justify" to "-align",
    because (at least in the case of the header labels) this actually
    specifies not only the justification, but also the anchor point.
    Hopefully, this POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY will not break too many
    existing applications, because the column alignments are usually
    specified within the "-columns" global option.

5.  Fixed a bug that raised an error when some configuration options
    were specified at widget creation time before the "-columns" option
    (thanks to Bastien Chevreux for his bug report).

6.  Reverted the implementation of the focus control to that contained
    in the pre-1.6 Tablelist releases, because its simplified version
    from the last release failed to work as expected if a tablelist was
    the only widget taking the focus during keyboard traversal (thanks
    to Juri Shimon for his bug report).

7.  Fixed a bug that caused an erronous return value of the "labels"
    subcommand if the arrow indicating the sorting order was displayed.

8.  Several performance improvements, kindly contributed by Patrick
    Fradin.

9.  To improve the performance even further, the invocations of "info
    exists" for array elements are no longer replaced with a call to a
    helper procedure (introduced in Tablelist 1.2), because the Tcl bug
    that made this necessary for Tcl versions 8.2, 8.3.0 - 8.3.2, and
    8.4a1 was fixed in Tcl 8.3.3 and 8.4a2.  If for some reason you
    cannot upgrade your Tcl/Tk version, then you should patch the file
    "tablelistWidget.tcl" with the aid of the script "repair.tcl", as
    described in the files "README.txt" and "tablelist.html".

10. The demo script "browse.tcl" now inserts an image into the first
    cell of each row of the tablelist widget.

11. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 1.6?
------------------------------

1. The value of the "-stretch" configuration option is now ignored if
   the width of the tablelist widget was specified as zero or less.
   This change was necessary in order to improve the behavior of
   dynamic-width tablelist widgets with the "-setgrid" option set to
   true.

2. By pressing mouse button 1 over a header label, the label's relief
   is now only changed to "sunken" if the value of the global or
   column-specific "-labelcommand" option is nonempty.

3. Several improvements concerning hidden columns (thanks to Juri
   Shimon for his bug report).

4. Made the focus control more straight-forward.

5. Extended the "How to use it?" section of the tutorial
   "tablelist.html".

What was new in Tablelist 1.5?
------------------------------

This version contains mainly bug fixes and small improvements.  Many
thanks to Andres Garcia, Bastien Chevreux, and Patrick Fradin for their
valuable contributions.

1. Fixed a bug concerning the "-label*" configuration options.

2. Fixed the erronous invocation of "getSubCmd" in the selection
   handler "fetchSelection" (this bug was introduced in version 1.1).

3. Elements that don't fit into their cells are now displayed with a
   trailing or leading ellipsis ("..."), depending on the column
   alignment.

4. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 1.4?
------------------------------

1. New "-stretch" configuration option specifying the columns that are
   to be stretched in order to eliminate the blank space that might
   appear at the right of the table.

2. Improved the error handling in the "attrib", "configure",
   "columnconfigure", "rowconfigure", and "cellconfigure" subcommands.

3. Improved the demo scripts "browse.tcl" and "config.tcl".

What was new in Tablelist 1.3?
------------------------------

1. The "sortbycolumn" subcommand now per default places an up- or
   down-arrow indicating the sorting order into the respective column's
   label.  This can be enabled or disabled with the new "-showarrow"
   configuration option, at both widget and column level.

2. New configuration options "-arrowcolor", "-arrowdisabledcolor", and
   "-incrarrowtype" to control the appearance of the arrow mentioned
   above.

3. New "resetsortinfo" subcommand, used to reset the information about
   the sorting of the items.

4. Improved the demo script "browse.tcl".

5. Further improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 1.2?
------------------------------

1. Whereever possible, eliminated the invocations of "info exists" for
   array elements.  This works around a severe bug in Tcl versions 8.2
   and 8.3 (fixed in 8.4a2), which causes excessive memory use when
   calling "info exists" on a non-existent array element.  Some serious
   memory leaks in earlier Tablelist versions when run under Tcl/Tk 8.2
   or 8.3 (reported by Henning Hanusa and Christian Burrini) could be
   tracked down to this very annoying Tcl bug (which I was not aware of
   until recently).

2. The help variables used in the initialization of the "tablelist"
   namespace are now declared with the "variable" keyword, in order to
   avoid any conflicts with global variables.

3. Improved the parsing of configuration and command options.

What was new in Tablelist 1.1?
------------------------------

This version contains mainly bug fixes and small improvements.  Many
thanks to Patrick Fradin, Bastien Chevreux, and Mats Bengtsson for
their valuable contributions.

1. Fixed some bugs in the implementation of the "-listvariable" option.
   Also, the value of this option can now be an array element, not only
   a scalar variable.

2. Fixed a bug in the implementation of the "get" subcommand.

3. New "sortcolumn" and "sortorder" subcommands to query the arguments
   of the last sorting.

4. Improved the look & feel of tablelist widgets on the Macintosh.

5. Worked around a bug in Tk 8.3.0 (fixed in 8.3.1) concerning listbox
   widgets with configured "-cursor" option.

6. Several further improvements and minor bug fixes.

What was new in Tablelist 1.0?
------------------------------

1.  New "-resizable" option for the "columnconfigure" subcommand.

2.  New "labels" subcommand. returning the list of the header labels.

3.  The "-disabledforeground" and "-state" configuration options no
    longer require Tk version 8.3 or higher.

4.  All "-label*" column configuration options can now have an empty
    string as value, meaning that the corresponding global option will
    be used instead of the column-specific one.

5.  Improved the output of the "columnconfigure" subcommand.

6.  The help variables used in the coordinate transformations within
    the scripts defined for the "TablelistBody" binding tag have been
    moved into the "tablelist" namespace, in order to avoid any
    conflicts with global variables.

7.  Improved cross-platform support with the aid of the new <<Button3>>
    virtual event.

8.  Fixed a bug in the "compareAsSet" procedure of the demo script
    "config.tcl".

9.  New demo script "browse.tcl", containing a simple widget browser
    based on a tablelist.

10. Both demo scripts now use a namespace for their procedures, to
    avoid any conflicts when evaluating them with the "source" command.

11. The tutorial "tablelist.html" is now completed and includes a
    detailed discussion of both demo scripts mentioned above.

12. Numerous further improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Tablelist 0.9?
------------------------------

1. The documentation now includes the tutorial "tablelist.html" (part
   of which is still work in progress), as well as reference pages for
   the two exported commands "tablelist::tablelist" and
   "tablelist::sortByColumn".

2. The "-listvariable" configuration option is now fully implemented.

3. A column of a tablelist widget can now be made invisible by using
   the new "-hide" option of the "columnconfigure" subcommand.

4. The contents of a row can now be updated with the new "-text" option
   of the "rowconfigure" subcommand.

5. For Tk versions 8.3 or higher the "tablelist::tablelist" command now
   supports the "-disabledforeground", "-labeldisabledforeground", and
   "-state" configuration options.

6. Replaced "[focus]" with "[focus -displayof $win]", so that the code
   will work properly in applications using multiple displays.
   Similarly, the "font measure" command is now invoked with the
   "-displayof $win" option.  This also works around a peculiarity of
   the "font measure" command.

7. Renamed "tablelistBindingTag" to "Tablelist".

8. Fixed a bug in the private procedure "colIndex", for arguments of
   the form "@x,y".  This procedure is invoked (directly or indirectly)
   in the implementation of all commands that take a column or cell
   index or an x coordinate as argument.

9. Numerous further improvements and minor bug fixes.
