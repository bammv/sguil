Sguil (pronounced "sgweel") is a graphical interface to snort 
(www.snort.org), an open source intrusion detection system. 
The actual interface and GUI server are written in tcl/tk 
(www.tcl.tk). Sguil also relies on other open source software 
in order to function properly. 

That list includes barnyard, mysql (www.mysql.com), ethereal 
(www.ethereal.com), 
tcpflow (http://www.circlemud.org/~jelson/software/tcpflow/), 
and awhois.sh (ftp://ftp.weird.com/pub/local/awhois.sh). 
Sguil currently functions as an analysis interface and has 
no snort sensor or rule management capabilities. 

We hope to add those features in later releases.

Files are located in the directory named for where they
will be installed.

./client -- Contains
	 sguil.tk -- Analysis GUI client and
	 its conf file. 
	 
	 ./lib -- contains some tcl scripts 
	 that are needed by the client.

./sensor -- Contains 
	 sensor_agent.tcl --  a script that runs on the
	 sensor that takes input from barnyard and sends
         alerts to the sguild server.  It also loads 
	 portscan, session, and sensor statistics to the 
         sguild server.
	 
	 log_packets.sh -- a shell script that runs a 
	 second instance of snort to log all packets 
	 for correlation.  Meant to be installed in a
	 crontab.
	 
	 ./snort_mods -- patches to snorts portscan and
	 stream4 preprocessors.  Most of the changes in
	 these patches are output related and do not 
	 effect the functionality of the preprocessor.

	 ./barnyad_mods -- A barnyard output plugin 
	 (op_sguil.{c,h}) and a patch to integrate it.
         NOTE: Barnyard-0.2.0 includes the sguil output
         plugin.
	 
	 ./contrib -- some stuff someone gave us...don't
	 ask me how to use it.

./server -- Contains 
	 sguild -- The Sguil Server (again a TCL script)
	 and its conf file.  This is the brains behind this
	 whole mess.  This stuff gets installed on the 
	 database server.  
	 
	 sguild.users -- a text file with
	 username:password pairs.  This is only for history
	 tracking at this point.  There is no authentication. 
	 
	 xscriptd -- A TCL script that takes requests from 
	 the client for correlation data, goes and gets the 
	 packets off of the sensor, and then sends them to 
	 the client.

         autocat.conf  -- Configuration file for sguild auto-
         categorization.

         sguild.reports -- Configuration file for canned 
         sensor report queries

         sguild.queries --  Configuration file for Standard
         queries

         sguild.access -- Configuration file for User access-
         control

         sguild.email -- Configuration file for automatic
         emails on alerts from sguild.
	 
	 ./sql_scripts -- Scripts to create the sguildb 
	 database structure.


./doc -- A bunch of (hopefully) helpful documents.

./contrib -- some more stuff, ya got me.


Happy Fun Time!!11!!!!
